This repository collects a computational pipeline to mine geospatial data through Google Earth Engine in Grasshopper 3D, via its most recent Hops component. To read more about case studies and applications refer to [I.Neri, Expanding Digital Design Workflows with Geospatial Analytics](https://doi.org/10.14627/537740047)

Since v3 all components have been converted to standalone Python Script components in order to avoid the installation step.
Make sure to have the latest version of Rhinoceros 8 running.

## Requirements

-   [Rhinoceros 8](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/) (Win) & Hops (tested with 0.16)

-   [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) Register to GEE in order to access the service
